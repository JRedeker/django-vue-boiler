# django-vue-postgres-boiler
A boilerplate (and quick example) for using Django and Postgres with a Vue frontend

# Instructions
run with:
`python manage.py runserver &`
`cd frontend`
`npm run dev &`

# Note
This uses the full js experience of vue-cli with npm/webpack to serve the front end rather than using Django templates.
